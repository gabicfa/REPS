# Reps

The aim of the project is to improve the optimization and to understand the operation of the Atmel SAME70 board. From this focus, students Gabriel Rios and Gabriela Almeida developed an Automatic Repetition Counter aimed at its use in gyms. The main idea is to get a user who regularly trains and improves his performance through a device that counts automatically how many repetitions he has already performed while verifying that the repetition was valid. In this way, the user can think of other subjects when performing the exercise. 

An Android app was also developed to provide an interface where the user could configure the device and be warned when the exercise was over.
